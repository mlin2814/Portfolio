                                <p>Well, gosh, I'm so flattered you came to read this little 'About Me', you shouldn't have. So since you're here, let me give you the grand tour. My name is Matthew, and I'm currently looking into being a junior developer for a career change. Prior to this, I was an English teacher, but circumstances changed and led me to seek something different.</p>
                                <div class=".img-responsive">
                                <img src="images/DSC02440.jpg" alt="Your Name" style="width:300px; height: 250px; margin-right: 20px;" align="left">
                                </div>
                                <p>But that's enough about the professional side of me, here's the good stuff. I'm one of the biggest nerds you'll meet. Star Wars, Marvel Comics, Steven Universe, pretty much anything that is considered "nerdy", either I grew up with it or have some passing familiarity with. I love learning about all of these things, and it helps fuel my imagination for what is possible. I'm also prepared to handle lots of different situations; it pays to be prepared. You'll find me with a bag full of useful items that get me through the day efficiently and without hassle. People have called my bag the TARDIS of carry-alls. They're not wrong.</p>
                                <p>If this has interested you, and you want to know more, please contact me through any of my channels.</p>
